### Problems
Apply greedy strategy to solve various computational problems:
* [`/src/change/Change.java`](src/change/Change.java): Problem 1, changes money optimally;
* [`/src/fractional_knapsack/FractionalKnapsack.java`](src/fractional_knapsack/FractionalKnapsack.java): Problem 2, finds the maximumal value of fractions of items that fit into the fractional knapsack;
* [`/src/dot_product/DotProduct.java`](src/dot_product/DotProduct.java): Problem 3, minimizes the dot product of a sequence of integer numbers;
* [`/src/covering_segments/CoveringSegments.java`](src/covering_segments/CoveringSegments.java): Problem 4, marks as few points on a line as possible so that each line segment contains at least one marked point;
* [`/src/different_summands/DifferentSummands.java`](src/different_summands/DifferentSummands.java): Problem 5, represents a given positive integer number as a sum of as many pairwise distinct positive integers as possible.
